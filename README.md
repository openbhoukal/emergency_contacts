# Emergency Contacts Application

This repository contains the full source code for the **Emergency Contacts** CRUD application.  The project is split into two main parts:

1. **Backend** – a Django REST Framework service that exposes a simple REST API to manage emergency contact records.  It uses MySQL as the database and includes everything you need to get up and running quickly (models, serializers, viewsets, URL routing and a database schema script).
2. **Frontend** – an Angular single‑page application that consumes the API and provides a user friendly interface for creating, reading, updating and deleting contacts.  The UI implements the search, pagination and form validation requirements described in the machine test.

To run the backend and frontend locally you should install the appropriate dependencies (Python, Django, Node.js and Angular CLI).  The included README files in each subdirectory explain how to install and run each part of the project.
